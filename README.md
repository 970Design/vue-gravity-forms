# What is Vue Gravity Forms?

Vue Gravity Forms is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) 3 component which allows you to render and process [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) in a headless [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) environment via the Companion [WordPress Plugin](https://github.com/970Design/nsz-vue-gravity-forms-plugin).  This component will work in any environment where Vue is supported (such as [Astro.js](https://astro.build/)).  Currently, it supports all Basic and Advanced field types, confirmation messages and redirects, file uploads, multipage forms, and (optionally) Google reCAPTCHA v3.

## Setup Guide

- Install and activate the [Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/) plugin in your headless WordPress site, and create a form.
- Install and active the companion [Vue Gravity Forms Plugin](https://github.com/970Design/nsz-vue-gravity-forms-plugin) in your headless WordPress site, configure it with your allowed origins and get your API Key.
- Install this package in your front-end project using npm (or your favorite package manager):
    - `npm install @970design/vue-gravity-forms`
- Import and use the `VueGravityForms` component in your front-end project, passing the required props (see example below) - including the `apiKey` which is provided by the companion WordPress plugin.

## Example Usage (with Astro.js)

```javascript
---
import VueGravityForms from "@970design/vue-gravity-forms";

const formId = 1;
const endpoint = 'https://my-headless-wordpress.com';
const apiKey = import.meta.env.GF_API_KEY;
---

  <VueGravityForms
    client:load
    formId={formId}
    endpoint={endpoint}
    apiKey={apiKey}
    recaptchaKey="OPTIONAL_RECAPTCHA_KEY"
